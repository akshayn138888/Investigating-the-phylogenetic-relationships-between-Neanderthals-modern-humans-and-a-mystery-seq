Investigating the phylogenetic relationships between Neanderthals, modern humans, and a “mystery sequence”

Critique : for For better population scale analysis, more evolution is required in terms of
storage of the data but there is no point of storing data in a compression based model if the query
time is only as good as what is available today. An all-round approach is what we should look for
in the future. It is only possible with better coordination and communication between experts of
different fields which is the core of bioinformatics.
